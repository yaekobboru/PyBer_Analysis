# Overview of the analysis

This analysis supports decision to be made by Pyber a ride sharing company serving people at different city types.
Total number of riders, fares, and drivers with average values calculated per city type to make recommendations. 
The result will help Pyber management to decide improve access to underserved neighborhoods.
city data and ride data csv files got analyzed using pandas library, jupyter note book and matplotlib.

# Results

There are 1625 total rides for urban compared to suburban(625) and rural(125). The  number of drivers who operate 
on urban areas (59602) are an enormous amount compared to suburban and rural which are less than 10,000 combined. 
The total fares also indicate similar trends as the total number of drivers. Total fares for urban areas show the
 highest figure 39854 whereas suburban and rural combined show half the fares for urban 19356 and 4327 respectively.
Due to the number of riders figure the average fare per ride and driver figures show less figures for urban areas. 
The highest figure of average fare per driver is $8.06 for rural. urban drivers earn less than a dollar on average. 
The average fare per ride for rural, suburban and urban show a slightly close figure. They are 34,30, and 24 respectively.  

# Summary
  
 * The result show there are almost no drivers at rural areas (537) compared to urban areas (59602). This clearly
   show existence of underserved neighborhood. The management should focus on motivating riders to work on rural  
 area by special incentives.
 * The number of rides is low at rural areas and the average fare per ride is higher compared to suburban and urban. 
 decreasing the fare for rural users can directly affect the total rides figure to increase.
 * The management should apply the same recommendations provided above for suburban.
